# style-transfer-of-arbitrary-region

This is the code for the paper:
Local Perceptual Loss Function for Arbitrary Region Style Transfer (ICPR2018 under  reviewing)

## About
This is a tensorflow implementation of a conditional style transfer network which is trained to realize style transfer of arbitrary region. The conditional transfer network has two inputs, one is content image, the other one is a mask image.
